## Features

* Works offline - no internet connection required, no user account to create
* Editor allows you to create your own adventures
* Share your creations with your friends (using iOS built-in share function)

## Manual
The app comes by default with no predefined adventure, so you will have to create one first.


You can also use relative paths like

![Menu Screen](_doc/screen_menu.png?raw=true "Menu screen")

From there, click on the **"+"** button. Enter a name for your adventure and touch the **Create** button.

![Create Screen](_doc/screen_create.png?raw=true "Create screen")

You can now select your adventure and edit it.
